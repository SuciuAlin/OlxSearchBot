## The idea behind this app

I was in search for a new laptop. Searched like a freak for the perfect deal, hours and hours for weeks. 

Got the deal, but also the realization that this process can be automated so I start searching for the perfect solution.

 With the will of implementing content known from uni I used this set to achieve this result.
